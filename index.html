          <span class="fw-bold">1890-1900:</span> Before 1900<br />
          Picasso's training under his father began before 1890.In 1897, his
          realism began to show a Symbolist influence, for example, in a series
          of landscape paintings rendered in non-naturalistic violet and green
          tones. Picasso made his first trip to Paris, then the art capital of
          Europe, in 1900.

        <li class="col-lg-7 mt-3">
          <span class="fw-bold">1901–1904:</span> Blue Period<br />
          This period is characterized by sombre paintings rendered in shades of
          blue and blue-green only occasionally warmed by other colours, began
          either in Spain in early 1901 or in Paris in the second half of the
          year.

        <li class="col-lg-7 mt-3">
          <span class="fw-bold">1904–1906:</span> Rose Period<br />
          The Rose Period is characterised by a lighter tone and style utilising
          orange and pink colours and featuring many circus people, acrobats and
          harlequins known in France as saltimbanques.

          <span class="fw-bold">1907–1909:</span> African art and primitivism<br />
          It begins with his painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. The three
          figures on the left were inspired by Iberian sculpture, but he
          repainted the faces of the two figures on the right after being
          powerfully impressed by African artefacts he saw in June 1907 in the
          ethnographic museum at Palais du Trocadéro.

        <li class="col-lg-7 mt-3">
          <span class="fw-bold">1909–1912:</span> Analytic cubism<br />
          Analytic cubism is a style of painting Picasso developed with Georges
          Braque using monochrome brownish and neutral colours. Both artists
          took apart objects and "analyzed" them in terms of their shapes.
          Picasso and Braque's paintings at this time share many similarities.

        <li class="col-lg-7 mt-3">
          <span class="fw-bold">1912–1919:</span> Synthetic cubism<br />
          It was a further development of the genre of cubism, in which cut
          paper fragments – often wallpaper or portions of newspaper pages –
          were pasted into compositions, marking the first use of collage in
          fine art. Between 1915 and 1917, Picasso began a series of paintings
          depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting
          of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of
          collage. During World War I, his paintings became more sombre and his
          life changed with dramatic consequences.

          <span class="fw-bold">1919–1929:</span> Neoclassicism and
          surrealism<br />
          In February 1917, Picasso made his first trip to Italy. In the period
          following the upheaval of World War I, Picasso produced work in a
          neoclassical style. In 1925 the Surrealist writer and poet André
          Breton declared Picasso as 'one of ours' in his article Le Surréalisme
          et la peinture, published in Révolution surréaliste.

          <span class="fw-bold">1930–1939:</span> The Great Depression to MoMA
          exhibition<br />
          During the 1930s, the minotaur replaced the harlequin as a common
          motif in his work. His use of the minotaur came partly from his
          contact with the surrealists, who often used it as their symbol, and
          it appears in Picasso's Guernica. The minotaur and Picasso's mistress
          Marie-Thérèse Walter are heavily featured in his celebrated Vollard
          Suite of etchings. In 1939 and 1940, the Museum of Modern Art in New
          York City, under its director Alfred Barr, a Picasso enthusiast, held
          a major retrospective of Picasso's principal works until that time.

          <span class="fw-bold">1939–1949:</span> World War II and late 1940s<br />
          During World War II, Picasso remained in Paris while the Germans
          occupied the city. Picasso's artistic style did not fit the Nazi ideal
          of art, so he did not exhibit during this time.

        <li class="col-lg-7 mt-3">
          <span class="fw-bold">1949–1973:</span> Later works to final years<br />
          Picasso was one of 250 sculptors who exhibited in the 3rd Sculpture
          International held at the Philadelphia Museum of Art in mid-1949. In
          the 1950s, Picasso's style changed once again, as he took to producing
          reinterpretations of the art of the great masters. He made a series of
          works based on Velázquez's painting of Las Meninas. He also based
          paintings on works by Goya, Poussin, Manet, Courbet and Delacroix.

          Pablo Picasso died on 8 April 1973 in Mougins, France, from pulmonary
          edema and heart failure at the age of 91.
